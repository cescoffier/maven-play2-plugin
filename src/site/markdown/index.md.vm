The ${project.artifactId} is used to build Play 2 applications using Maven. Basically, it just a wrapper around the _play_
command. It supports compilation, testing and packaging of the application.

Features
--------

* *Dependency Management*: libraries and modules used by your application are declared in the Maven POM file.
* *Java and Scala* : your application can use Java, Scala or both
* *Test*: your tests runs during the maven test phase
* *Build applications*: your application is packaged in an archive ready to be deployed
* *Build modules*: you can also build Play 2 modules

Goals Overview
---------------

The Play2 Plugin acts on projects using the _play2_ packaging type during the following phases:

* [${project.artifactId}:copy-dependencies](./copy-dependencies-mojo.html) copies the dependencies (from the compile
 scope) to the _lib_ folder.
* [${project.artifactId}:compile](./compile-mojo.html) compiles your application.
* [${project.artifactId}:test](./test-mojo.html) tests your application.
* [${project.artifactId}:package](./package-mojo.html) packages your application as a Jar and a Zip.
* [${project.artifactId}:clean](./clean-mojo.html) cleans the project.

There are also goals not bound to the Maven project lifecycle:

* [${project.artifactId}:run](./run-mojo.html) runs the application (ctrl-c to exit).


Usage
-----

General instructions on how to use the ${project.artifactId} can be found on the [usage page](./usage.html).
